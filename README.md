## Getting Started

First, install and confirm that WA Simulator is running on you computer. You must also already have ROS2 installed.

Add this repository as a submodule to your workspace, or download into your workspace.

There is one node `WASimulatorBridge.py`.  The WA Simulator must be launched and the `external_enable` parameter set to true in WASimulationManager.
